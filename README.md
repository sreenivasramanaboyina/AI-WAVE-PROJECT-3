The project aims to develop maze-solving algorithms inspired by human problem-solving strategies. Traditional maze-solving algorithms such as BFS or DFS, and A* search are efficient but may lack the intuitive decision-making capabilities of humans. By incorporating insights from human cognition and behavior, this project seeks to enhance existing algorithms to navigate mazes in a more human-like manner.By employing advanced machine learning algorithms, the system will analyze facial expressions, gestures, and vocal cues to accurately identify human emotions. Subsequently, the robot will adapt its behavior and responses accordingly, fostering more intuitive and empathetic interactions between humans and robots.
